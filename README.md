# hello-world
My first repository! I intend to be very active on GitHub!
I am from Clarksville, TN. I earned a BA in History from Tulane Univsersity in New Orleans, LA, USA in 2007. I also did Army ROTC at Tulane, so I commissioned into the U.S. Army as a Second Lieutenant in May 2007. I was in the Army for six years as an infantry officer includng one year in Iraq as an infantry platoon leader. I was working as a real estate agent in Columbus, GA when I decided to attend Coding Dojo. The main reason for wanting to learn to code was so that I could participate in scientific research. I was inspired by the first-ever picture of a black hole that was released in April 2019. When I realized that a computer algorithm made it possible, it made me want to learn how to code. In my spare time I enjoy learning new things, hitting the gym, and flying.
